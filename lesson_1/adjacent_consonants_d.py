# D: Data Structures:
#   -Thinking in terms of data structures is an important partt of the problem solving process
#   -Helps reason with data logically
#   -Helps interact with data at the implementation stage
#   -Data structures are closely linked to the algorithm used for your solution

# Will be using lists for both input and output

# LaunchSchool:
# Need some way to keep track of adjacent consonants in each word, dictionary?
